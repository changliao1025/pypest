The template directory is the general structure of the pypest. In case you want to apple pypest to a new model, you can copy the content inside the template directory then follow the examples in the example directory.

The models directory contains several models that are already supported by pypest:

1. modflow

2. swat

3. prms

4. maces

Although pypest supports these models, it was not our desire to consider all possible parameters in our study. You can custmize the existing models to meet your own cases.
